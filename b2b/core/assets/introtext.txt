In the January 2020, the world as we know changed...
Small things that we took for granted ended...
A deadly virus spread around the globe...
They said it was just a flu virus...
How they were wrong!!!
Isolation was enforce to stop the deadly virus from spreading even more!
Quarantine measures were taken by countries, the ones that took too much time to act suffered more...
Rich countries buried their dead in commom graves, no burial ceremony is allow, it was not time to mourn the dead.
A fight for survival began with resources getting scarce day by day.
The fight for his survival, conscious that he must survive the confining.
