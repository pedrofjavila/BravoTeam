In January of 2020, the world as we knew changed...
Small things that we took for granted, ended...
A deadly virus spread around the globe...
They said it was just a flue...
How they were wrong!!!
Isolation was enforced in order to stop the deadly virus from spreading even more!
Quarantine measures were taken by countries. The ones that took too much time to act suffered the consequences...
Rich countries buried their dead in common graves, no burial ceremonies allowed. It was not time to mourn the dead.
A fight for survival began with resources getting scarce day by day.
You must fight, if needed, to survive. Conscious that you must be aware of the advantages of the confining.
